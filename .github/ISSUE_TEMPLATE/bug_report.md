Help us help you. 

1. The vast majority of issues encountered will go away after a reboot of your computer. This is our experience over many games over many years. Please try that. If the issue persist across a restart of your  computer, then proceed. 

2.  **It is very important that you NOT restart the game before you save the output log**
 Log file location: 
   ** Windows 10** (currently the only supported platform)
      The log file location is here under Windows 10 (currently the only supported platform). 
           `c:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\LocalLow\Knuckle Cracker\Creeper World 4\output_log.txt`
      Alternately, copy and paste this short-form file location into the address bar of Windows File Explorer
             `%LOCALAPPDATA%Low\Knuckle Cracker\Creeper World 4`

3. If the error persists over a save and reload of the game, please provide the save file as well (You may have to zip it up, as the .cw4 file type is not supported as a direct upload in GitHub)
  Each part of the game (Farsite, Chronom, Mark V, etc.( has a folder underneath the game's home directory.
         `%HOMEPATH%\Documents\My Games\creeperworld4\saves\`
   If you were saving in the Map Editor, then the save is in the folder for the map in 
         `%HOMEPATH%\Documents\My Games\creeperworld4\editor\`

4. Screenshots help us to **see**the problem. 
  Screenshots are here
'C:\Users\YOUR_USER\Documents\My Games\creeperworld4\screenshots\'

   Use F11, or F12(steam screenshot) and take a screenshot of the game (if you use both, that's also great).  If you refer to a specific part of the screen, a smaller, localized screenshot helps, but the large screenshots let us see if something else in the game is an issue. 

5. Describe the bug 
   A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Can you recreate it? What steps is needed to recreate it?
