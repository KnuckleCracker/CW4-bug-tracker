Help us help you. 

1. The vast majority of issues encountered will go away after a reboot of your computer. This is our experience over many games over many years. Please try that. If the issue persist across a restart of your  computer, then proceed. 

2.  **It is very important that you NOT restart the game before you save the output log**
 Log file location: 
   ** Windows 10** (currently the only supported platform)
      The log file location is here under Windows 10 (currently 
`c:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\LocalLow\Knuckle Cracker\Creeper World 4\output_log.txt`

3. Screenshots help! 
  Screenshots are here
'C:\Users\YOUR_USER\Documents\My Games\creeperworld4\screenshots\'

   Use F11, or F12(steam screenshot) and take a screenshot of the game (if you use both, that's also great).  If you refer to a specific part of the screen, a smaller, localized screenshot helps, but the large screenshots let us see if something else in the game is an issue. 

4. Describe the bug 
   A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Can you recreate it? What steps is needed to recreate it?
